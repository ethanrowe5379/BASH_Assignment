# BASH_Assignment

Standard Functionality
The minimal functionality that your solution should be able to demonstrate is:

• a menu or command+argument based front end (Jack)
• creating a new repository (Ethan)
• adding files to the repository (Ethan)
• checking a file out of the repository, and back in again (Jack)
• creation of a log file with updates (Ethan)

Simple Extensions
There are many possible extensions that you could pursue, such as:

• multi-level menus / complex arguments (Jack)
• allowing access to multiple repositories (accessed by name) (Jack)
• being able to edit a text file from within your script (Haseeb)
• some form of validation on what the user inputs e.g. “invalid entry” or “that file was not
found” (Everyone)
• automatically listing the contents of the file repository currently in use (Jack)
• optionally adding user comments into log entries (Ethan)
• automatically making backup copies of each file which is edited (Haseeb)

Further Extensions
More advanced extensions could include:

• providing secure access to sets of files, exploiting the user ID and group ID stored by UNIX
(you may need to arrange to have several accounts created for you to test this extension)
• roll back i.e. return to an earlier version of the file(s), either by undoing the edits or by
restoring an earlier version of the file(s)
• a facility to archive a whole project into a TAR or ZIP file (and possibly to access existing
archive file)
• integrating other tools into your scripts, for example, to allow you to compile a project from
its source code
